<h1>Quiz Web App</h1>

### About the Project 
This is a dynamic Quiz Web App developed using React, leveraging the power of various React hooks for efficient state management, side effects handling, and component functionalities.

<h1>Features</h1>

1) Multiple Quizzes: Users can access different quizzes available on the platform.<br>
2) Interactive UI: Engaging user interface for answering questions.<br>
3) Scoring: Users can view their scores at the end of each quiz.<br>
4) React Hooks Utilized:
    .useState: For managing local component state, such as user answers and quiz progress.<br>
    .useEffect: Handling side effects like fetching quiz data, updating scores, or managing lifecycle events.<br>
    .useRef: Assisting in accessing and manipulating DOM elements within the application.<br>
    .useReducer: For more complex state management, particularly in handling quiz logic or user interactions.<br>
    .useCallback and useMemo: Optimizing performance by memoizing functions or values that rely on dependencies.<br>
